* We assume that the admins give the employees performance reviews. 
* We assume that there are more than one admin (But for now we only hardcoded one admin in request)
* We assume that when assigned, an employee can submit feedback to a review.
* Assume only admin can write performance review, there is a component to assign employee to participate but because the requirement is not clear this part is not implemented.
* Assume that employee can only view and submit feedback.
* Assume just clicking on the link to view the data, not have enough time to implement access control for the app.
* Assume data goes to a mongodb backend on the cloud.
